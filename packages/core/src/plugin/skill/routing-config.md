# Routing Config

How to change what OpenCode shows and how routed models are chosen, with the exact
keys. Read this before you edit a config file. Change nothing until the user
approves the specific change.

## Where config lives

- Project settings: `opencode.jsonc` (or `opencode.json`) at the project root.
  Global settings: the OpenCode config directory, `~/.config/opencode/`. Project
  values override global ones. `opencode config` lists the files OpenCode reads.
- OpenCode reloads config files on change. A request already in progress keeps the
  settings it started with.
- JSONC allows comments and trailing commas. Keep both valid when you edit.
- OpenChamber's Auto categories are not in this file. They live in OpenChamber's
  `routing.json` (see routing-review, section 1).

## Providers: turn on or off

- Turn one off: `"disabled_providers": ["<providerID>"]`. Its models leave every
  picker, and pool targets that use it cannot be reached.
- Allow-list: `"enabled_providers": ["<providerID>", ...]` turns off every provider
  it does not name. Use it only when the user asks for an allow-list.
- The same thing as policies, in `experimental.policies`:
  `{ "action": "provider.use", "resource": "<providerID>", "effect": "deny" }`, or
  `"allow"` to switch a denied provider back on.
- In OpenChamber, Settings → Providers has an on/off control. `/connect` in OpenCode
  connects a provider. Never edit credential files by hand.

## Models: hide, show, add

Model entries sit under `providers`:

```jsonc
{
  "providers": {
    "<providerID>": {
      "models": {
        "<modelID>": { "disabled": true },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

- `disabled: true` hides the model from the picker and takes it out of routing.
- Show it again: set `"disabled": false`, or delete the key.
- Add a model the catalog does not list: a new key under `models` with `modelID`
  (the provider's real id), `name`, and `limit` (`context`, `output`).
- In OpenChamber, hiding a model from the model picker is a UI-only setting. OpenCode
  and the pools still use the model. The config key is what changes what routing
  can reach.

## Pools: define and change

A pool is `experimental.model_routes.<id>`. OpenCode and OpenChamber show it as the
model `opencode-route/<id>`.

```jsonc
{
  "experimental": {
    "model_routes": {
      "cheap-fast": {
        "targets": ["openai/gpt-6-luna", "github-copilot/gpt-6-luna"],
        "selection": "weighted",
        "weights": { "openai/gpt-6-luna": 3, "github-copilot/gpt-6-luna": 1 },
        "autonomy": "agent",
        "health": { "firstTokenTimeoutMs": 10000, "cooldownMs": 60000 },
        "budgets": { "openai/gpt-6-luna": { "requestsPerDay": 500, "softLimit": 0.9 } },
        "attempts": 1,
        "hedgeAfterMs": 8000,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

- `targets`: `"provider/model"`, `"provider/model#variant"`, or
  `{ "model": "provider/model", "defaultVariant", "variants", "until" }`. `until` is
  an epoch-millisecond time after which the target leaves the pool. A target can be
  another pool, written `"opencode-route/<id>"`. A `*` in a target stays inside that
  provider and is case-sensitive. `targets` is optional when a matching key below
  adds models.
- Matching keys pick models across every connected provider, ignoring case. A
  provider that is not connected contributes nothing until it is:
  - `include`: patterns that add models, e.g. `["*luna*", "anthropic/*haiku*"]`.
    `*` is any run of characters; a pattern with `/` is tested against
    `provider/model`, one without against the model id; `re:` starts a regular
    expression, unanchored unless it uses `^` or `$`.
  - `exclude`: patterns that remove models, including targets and the members of
    nested pools. `["*-5"]` drops `luna-5` and keeps `luna-5.5`.
  - `contains`, `notContains`: plain text found in the model id, or in
    `provider/model` when it has a `/`. `["haiku", "sonnet"]`.
  - `match`: one expression with `and`, `or`, `not` and parentheses, e.g.
    `"(*luna* or *haiku*) and not *mini*"`. Quote a term with spaces or parentheses:
    `"'re:gpt-(5|6)$' or *luna*"`. There is no `xor`.
  - An entry or term that is exactly another pool's id, or `opencode-route/<id>`,
    stands for that pool's models, without its weights or effort settings. A pool
    naming itself gets nothing from that name.
  - Order: targets first, then matched models in provider order, each model once;
    then the removals.
- Effort levels (variants):
  - `variants` on a target object remaps a level, `{ "xhigh": "high" }`; `false`
    makes the target sit that level out, `{ "max": false }`. A target that sits out
    a level is never used at it, not even as a last resort.
  - `variantRules`: `[{ "match": "*argon*", "map": { "xhigh": "high", "max": false } }]`.
    `match` takes a pattern, pool name or expression. Later rules override earlier
    ones per level; a target's own `variants` override every rule.
  - `levels`: `["low", "medium", "high"]` makes the pool offer exactly those. A
    target that cannot run one sits it out; a level no target can run is dropped
    and logged. Without `levels`, a level is offered when every target runs it or
    sits it out.
- `selection`: `ordered` (the default), `round-robin`, or `weighted`.
- `weights`: relative ratios keyed by target. A target not listed weighs 1. Models
  from matching keys are keyed by `provider/model` too.
- `autonomy`: `fixed`, `rules`, `adaptive`, `predictive`, or `agent`. Each level
  includes the ones before it. `agent` also exposes `route_stats`, `route_usage` and
  `route_adjust` to the model.
- `health`, `budgets`, `attempts`, `hedgeAfterMs`: see routing-review, section 1.

A malformed pattern, regular expression or expression skips the whole pool, and a
pool with none of `targets`, `include`, `contains` and `match` is skipped too. The
config warning names the key. Check the log after editing a pool.

Common changes:

- Change a member's share: edit its `weights` entry. Ordered pools rank failover by
  weight too, so a weight change there also changes the order.
- Add a member: append it to `targets`, or widen `include`, and give it a `weights`
  entry if it should not weigh 1.
- Remove a member for good: delete it from `targets` and `weights`, or add it to
  `exclude`. For a temporary removal, give it an `until` instead, or use
  `route_adjust` skip.
- Keep a member out of one level: map that level to `false` in its `variants`, or in
  a `variantRules` entry that matches it.
- A new pool: add a new key under `model_routes`. Then point a category at
  `opencode-route/<id>` in OpenChamber (Settings → Routing).

## Time-of-day and temporary weights

- Inside one pool, `schedules` is a list. Each entry has `targets` (optional,
  wildcards allowed), `when`, and either `factor` (multiplies) or `weight` (replaces):

```jsonc
"schedules": [
  {
    "targets": ["deepseek/*"],
    "when": {
      "daysOfWeek": ["mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri"],
      "start": "09:00",
      "end": "17:00",
      "timezone": "America/Chicago",
    },
    "factor": 0.5,
    "note": "peak hours",
  },
],
```

- Across pools: `experimental.model_route_schedules`, a list of entries with
  `providers`, `models`, `targets`, `routes` (all optional), `when`, and `factor` or
  `weight`.
- `when` fields: `daysOfWeek` (`mon`..`sun`, or 0 to 6), `daysOfMonth` (1 to 31, or
  -1 for the last day), `start` and `end` as `HH:mm` (`end` exclusive; a start after
  the end runs past midnight), `timezone` (IANA), and `from` and `until` (epoch ms).
- A temporary fact ("credits expire Friday") belongs in `route_adjust`, not in config.
  It needs approval and it expires on its own.

## Tuning and notes

```jsonc
{
  "experimental": {
    "model_route_tuning": {
      "enabled": true,
      "intervalMinutes": 15,
      "windowHours": 24,
      "notes": ["openai/gpt-6-luna: out of quota, back in 3 hours"],
    },
  },
}
```

- `enabled` (default false) turns on the automatic review of history, which lowers or
  skips targets. It lapses on its own; it does not rewrite config.
- `notes`: one line each as `match: text`, where `match` is part of provider/model.
  A text that states a return time skips the match until then.

## Applying a change

1. Read the current value and show the user the before and after.
2. Get approval for that specific change.
3. Edit only the keys the change needs. Keep the rest of the file as it was.
4. Read the file back and check each key name against this skill.
5. Verify. For a pool change, run `route_stats` with `route` set. For a visibility or
   provider change, say what should now be missing from the model picker. Routing
   patterns need at least a day of history before they show.
6. Tell the user how to undo it: the previous value, in one line.
