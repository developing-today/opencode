export * as QuotaBurnRate from "./quota-burn-rate.js"

/**
 * Per-session burn-rate estimation for quota windows (epic #568, on the design #587 phase-1 signal):
 * how much of a window a typical session costs, bucketed by provider, model, and effort (the route
 * variant). Like `QuotaSnapshot`, an estimate is a pure derivation over recorded history — derived,
 * never stored — so the same samples plus the same options always give the same estimate, and it can
 * be tested without a database.
 *
 * A sample is one session's measured share of one window, in percent: callers derive it from
 * `ModelUsage.sessionReports` window shares (used / limit for the plan window the session drew on).
 * Samples whose session ran at a known effort carry it; samples without one land in the effort-less
 * bucket for their provider/model, which is also the fallback every effort bucket draws on while its
 * own history is thin.
 *
 * Cold start is explicit, never invented from data that is not there: below `minSamples` a bucket
 * falls back to the provider/model bucket across efforts, then to the configured prior for the
 * effort, then to the default prior. Every estimate names its `source`, so a consumer can tell a
 * measured rate from a prior at a glance — an observe-mode consumer (the only kind #568 sanctions
 * today) can show both; nothing in the selection path reads these estimates.
